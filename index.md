One of the things that excited me about the Physics Girl livestream was the
breakfast pancakes that she eats every day. With my own illness, I've had to
limit the foods I eat too (though not as much as Physics Girl), so I've been
interested in finding foods that might work well for me and taste good. The
pancakes are apparently delicious, so much so that even her husband Kyle eats
them every day.

Kyle said in the livestream that "we'll have to post a recipe later for people
at home to try", but as far as I know the recipe was never published. So this
is an unofficial recipe, to make it easy for me to try making them.

# Ingredients

<div>
  <label for="pancake-count">Enter the number of pancakes you want to make
  (original recipe makes 6 pancakes):</label>
  <input type="number" id="pancake-count" name="pancake-count" min="1" value="6">
</div>

Amounts were never mentioned in the stream, so I am purely guessing based on
camera footage and my own experiments.

- whole pistachios -- <span><span class="value">1/2</span> <span class="units">cup</span></span>
- vanilla: choose one of <span>{fresh vanilla bean -- <span><span class="value">1/2</span> <span class="units">tsp</span></span>}</span> or <span>{vanilla extract -- <span id="vanilla-extract-amount"><span class="value">1/4</span> <span class="units">tsp</span></span>}</span>
- pink lady apple -- <span><span class="value">1.5</span> <span class="units">apples</span></span>
- water -- just enough to get the consistency of the batter right, about <span><span class="value">1/2</span> <span class="units">cup</span></span>. You don't want the batter to be too runny.
- ground chia seeds -- <span><span class="value">2</span> <span class="units">tbsp</span></span>
- pecans (probably; it was in a different glass jar than the pistachios but were never called out in the live stream; later in the stream they mention that she eats pecans, whereas no other nuts were mentioned as far as I can tell) -- <span><span class="value">1/4</span> <span class="units">cup</span></span>
- carrot -- <span><span class="value">1</span> <span class="units">small</span></span>
- coconut oil -- <span><span class="value">1</span> <span class="units">tbsp</span></span>

# Directions

Blend the following ingredients (use a good blender; there's not a lot of
liquid so a poor blender will not be able to blend the ingredients):

- <span><span class="value">1/2</span> <span class="units">cup</span></span> pistachios
- <span>{fresh vanilla bean -- <span><span class="value">1/2</span> <span class="units">tsp</span></span>}</span> or <span>{vanilla extract -- <span id="vanilla-extract-amount"><span class="value">1/4</span> <span class="units">tsp</span></span>}</span>
  </span>
- <span><span class="value">1</span> <span class="units">pink lady apple</span></span> (with skin on)
- <span><span class="value">1/2</span> <span class="units">cup</span></span> water

Set aside some of what was blended for later to put on the pancakes as sauce,
while most of it will be used as part of the batter.

Mix the <span><span class="value">2</span> <span class="units">tbsp</span></span> ground chia seeds and <span><span class="value">1/4</span> <span class="units">cup</span></span> pecans into the batter.

Peel and grate the <span><span class="value">1</span> <span class="units">small</span></span> carrot and mix the carrot and the rest of the apple chunks (<span><span class="value">half</span></span> of an apple's worth) into the batter.

The consistency of the batter should be like cookie dough at this point.

Turn on the stove, put a frying pan on top, and heat the <span><span class="value">1</span> <span class="units">tbsp</span></span> coconut oil. Then add the batter in as small pancakes (diameter â‰ˆ 2 inches) and fry them. Flip over after a couple of. Keep flipping and cooking until they are crispy and cooked through. Serve with the sauce.
