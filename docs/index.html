<p>One of the things that excited me about the Physics Girl livestream
was the breakfast pancakes that she eats every day. With my own illness,
I’ve had to limit the foods I eat too (though not as much as Physics
Girl), so I’ve been interested in finding foods that might work well for
me and taste good. The pancakes are apparently delicious, so much so
that even her husband Kyle eats them every day.</p>
<p>Kyle said in the livestream that “we’ll have to post a recipe later
for people at home to try”, but as far as I know the recipe was never
published. So this is an unofficial recipe, to make it easy for me to
try making them.</p>

<p><label for="pancake-count">Enter the number of pancakes you want to
make (original recipe makes 6 pancakes):</label>
<input type="number" id="pancake-count" name="pancake-count" min="1" value="6"></p>
</div>
<p>Amounts were never mentioned in the stream, so I am guessing based on
camera footage and my own experiments.</p>
<ul>
<li>whole pistachios – <span class="amount"><span
class="value">1/2</span> <span class="units">cup</span></span></li>
<li>vanilla: choose one of {fresh vanilla bean – <span
class="amount"><span class="value">1/2</span> <span
class="units">tsp</span></span>} or {vanilla extract – <span
class="amount"><span class="value">1/2</span> <span
class="units">tsp</span></span>}</li>
<li>pink lady apple – <span class="amount"><span
class="value">1.5</span> <span class="units">apples</span></span></li>
<li>water – just enough to get the consistency of the batter right,
about <span class="amount"><span class="value">1/2</span> <span
class="units">cup</span></span>. You don’t want the batter to be too
runny.</li>
<li>ground chia seeds – <span class="amount"><span
class="value">2</span> <span class="units">tbsp</span></span></li>
<li>pecans (probably; it was in a different glass jar than the
pistachios but were never called out in the live stream; later in the
stream they mention that she eats pecans, whereas no other nuts were
mentioned as far as I can tell) – <span class="amount"><span
class="value">1/4</span> <span class="units">cup</span></span></li>
<li>carrot – <span class="amount"><span class="value">1</span> <span
class="units">small carrot</span></span></li>
<li>coconut oil – <span class="amount"><span class="value">1</span>
<span class="units">tbsp</span></span></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="directions">Directions</h1>
<p>Blend the following ingredients (use a good blender; there’s not a
lot of liquid so a poor blender will not be able to blend the
ingredients):</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="amount"><span class="value">1/2</span> <span
class="units">cup</span></span> pistachios</li>
<li>{fresh vanilla bean – <span class="amount"><span
class="value">1/2</span> <span class="units">tsp</span></span>} or
{vanilla extract – <span class="amount"><span class="value">1/2</span>
<span class="units">tsp</span></span>}</li>
<li><span class="amount"><span class="value">1</span> <span
class="units">pink lady apple</span></span> (with skin on)</li>
<li><span class="amount"><span class="value">1/2</span> <span
class="units">cup</span></span> water</li>
</ul>
<p>Set aside some of what was blended for later to put on the pancakes
as sauce, while most of it will be used as part of the batter.</p>
<p>Mix the <span class="amount"><span class="value">2</span> <span
class="units">tbsp</span></span> ground chia seeds and <span
class="amount"><span class="value">1/4</span> <span
class="units">cup</span></span> pecans into the batter.</p>
<p>Peel and grate the <span class="amount"><span class="value">1</span>
<span class="units">small carrot</span></span> and mix the carrot and
the rest of the apple chunks (<span class="amount"><span
class="value">1/2</span> <span class="units">apple</span></span>) into
the batter.</p>
<p>The consistency of the batter should be like cookie dough at this
point.</p>
<p>Turn on the stove, put a frying pan on top, and heat the <span
class="amount"><span class="value">1</span> <span
class="units">tbsp</span></span> coconut oil. Then add the batter in as
small pancakes (diameter ≈ 2 inches) and fry them. Flip over after a
couple of minutes. Keep flipping and cooking until they are crispy and
cooked through. Serve with the sauce.</p>
